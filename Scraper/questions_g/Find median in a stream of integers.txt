Given an input stream of N integers. The task is to insert these numbers into a new stream and find the median of the stream formed by each insertion of X to the new stream.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in the stream. Then the next N lines contains integer x denoting the number to be inserted into the stream.
Output:
For each element added to the stream print the floor of the new median in a new line.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= x <= 106
Example:
Input:
4
5
15
1Â 
3
Output:
5
10
5
4
Explanation:
Testcase 1: 
Flow in stream : 5, 15, 1, 3 
5 goes to stream --> median 5 (5) 
15 goes to stream --> median 10 (5, 15) 
1 goes to stream --> median 5 (5, 15, 1) 
3 goes to stream --> median 4 (5, 15, 1, 3)
