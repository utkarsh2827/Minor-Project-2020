Given a pattern as below and an integer n your task is to decode it and print nth row of it. The pattern follows as :
1
11
21
1211
111221
............

Input:
The first line of input is the number of test cases . Â Then T test cases follow . The first line of each test case is an integer N.

Output:
For each test case print the required nth row of the pattern.
Expected Time Complexity : O(N2)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1<=T<=20
1<=N<=20

Example:
Input:
2
2
3
Output:
11
21
