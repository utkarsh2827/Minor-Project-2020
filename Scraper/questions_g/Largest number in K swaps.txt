Given a number K and string S of digits denoting a positive integer, build the largest number possible by performing swap operations on the digits of S atmost K times.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer K. The second line of each test case contains a string of digits denoting a positive integer.
Output:
Print out the largest number possible.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
0 <   S <= 30
0 <   K  <= 10
Examples :
Input:
3
4
1234567
3
3435335
2
1034
Output:
7654321
5543333
4301
Explanation:
Testcase 1: Three swaps can make the input 1234567 to 7654321, swapping 1 with 7, 2 with 6 and finally 3 with 5.
