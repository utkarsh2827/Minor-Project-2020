Given a positive integer N. The task is to check if N is a power of 2. That is N is 2x for some x.
Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains a single positive integer N.
Output:
Print "YES" if it is a power of 2 else "NO" (Without the double quotes).
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
0 <= N <= 1018
Example:
Input :
2
1
98
Output :
YES
NO
Explanation:
Testcase 1:  1 is equal to 2 raised to 0 (20 == 1).
