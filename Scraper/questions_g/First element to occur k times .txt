Given an array of N integers. The task is to find the first element that occurs K number of times. If no element occurs K times the print -1. 
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of an array and the number K. The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting elements of the array A[ ].
Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required answer.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N, K <= 105
1<= A <= 106
Example:
Input :
1
7 2
1 7 4 3 4 8 7
Output :
7
Explanation:
