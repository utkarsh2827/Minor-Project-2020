Given a number N, check whether it is sparse or not. A number is said to be a sparse number if in the binary representation of the number no two or more consecutive bits are set.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.Â The first line of each test case is number 'N'.
Output:
Print '1' if the number is sparse andÂ '0' if the number is not sparse.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 103
Example:
Input:
2
2
3
Output:
1
0
Explanation:
Testcase 1: Binary Representation of 2 is 10, which is not having consecutive set bits. So, it is sparse number.
Testcase 2: Binary Representation of 3 is 11, which is having consecutive set bits in it. So, it is not a sparse number.
