Problem DescriptionGiven a string A, find the common palindromic sequence ( A sequence which does not need to be contiguous and is a pallindrome), which is common in itself.
You need to return the length of longest palindromic subsequence in A.
NOTE:
Your code will be run on multiple test cases (<=10). Try to come up with an optimised solution.Problem Constraints 1 <= |A| <= 1005Input FormatFirst and only argument is an string A.Output FormatReturn a integer denoting the length of longest palindromic subsequence in A.Example InputInput 1:

 A = "bebeeed"
Example OutputOutput 1:

 4
Example ExplanationExplanation 1:

 The longest common pallindromic subsequence is "eeee", which has a length of 4
