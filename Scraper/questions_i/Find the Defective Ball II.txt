You have 8 balls all look identical (in shape, color etc.). All of them have same weight except one defective ball which is heavier than others. You can use a two sided balance system (not the electronic one). Find the minimum no. of measures required to separate the defective ball and the way you separate it.

Answer is a integer.  Just put the number without any decimal places if its an integer. If the answer is Infinity, output Infinity.
