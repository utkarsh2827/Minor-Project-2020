Given an input stream of n integers, find the kth largest element for each element in the stream.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers k and n . Then in the next line are n space separated values of the array.
Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print the space separated values denoting the kth largest element at each insertion, if the kth largest element at a particular insertion in the stream doesn't exist print -1.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= K <= n
1 <= n <= 106
1 <= stream[] <= 105
Example:
Input:
2
4 6
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2
3 4
Output:
-1 -1 -1 1 2 3
3 4Â 
Explanation:
Testcase1:
k = 4
For 1, the 4th largest element doesn't exist so we print -1.
For 2, the 4th largest element doesn't exist so we print -1.
For 3, the 4th largest element doesn't exist so we print -1.
For 4, the 4th largest element is 1 {1, 2, 3, 4}
For 5, the 4th largest element is 2 {2, 3, 4 ,5}
for 6, the 4th largest element is 3 {3, 4, 5}
