Given an array of integers. Check whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero. 
Example 1:
Input: N = 5, arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
Output: true
Explanation: 0, -1 and 1 forms a triplet
with sum equal to 0.
Example 2:
Input: N = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: false
Explanation: No triplet with zero sum exists. 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the boolean function findTriplets() which takes the array arr[] and the size of the array (n) as inputs and returns True if the given array has a triplet with zero sum and False otherwise. 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constrains:
1 <= N <= 104
-106
 <= Ai <= 106
