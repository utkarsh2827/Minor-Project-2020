Problem DescriptionGiven an 1D integer array A of length N, find the length of longest subsequence which is first increasing then decreasing.Problem Constraints0 <= N <= 3000
 -107 <= A[i] <= 107Input FormatThe first and the only argument contains an integer array A.Output FormatReturn an integer representing the answer as described in the problem statement.Example InputInput 1:

 A = [1, 2, 1]

Input 2:

 A = [1, 11, 2, 10, 4, 5, 2, 1]
Example OutputOutput 1:

 3

Output 2:

 6
Example ExplanationExplanation 1:

 [1, 2, 1] is the longest subsequence.

Explanation 2:
