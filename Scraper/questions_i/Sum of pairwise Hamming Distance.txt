Problem DescriptionHamming distance between two non-negative integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given an array A of N non-negative integers, find the sum of hamming distances of all pairs of integers in the array. Return the answer modulo 1000000007.Problem Constraints1 <= |A| <= 200000
1 <= A[i] <= 109Input FormatFirst and only argument is array A.Output FormatReturn one integer, the answer to the problem.Example InputInput 1:
 A = [1]



Input 2:






 A = [2, 4, 6]





Example OutputOutput 1:
 0



Output 2:






 8





Example ExplanationExplanation 1:
 No pairs are formed.



Explanation 2:






 We return, f(2, 2) + f(2, 4) + f(2, 6) + f(4, 2) + f(4, 4) + f(4, 6) + f(6, 2) + f(6, 4) + f(6, 6) = 8
