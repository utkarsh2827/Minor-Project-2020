Giving a dictionary and a string ‘str’, your task is to find the longest string in dictionary of size x which can be formed by deleting some characters of the given ‘str’.
Examples:
Input : dict = {"ale", "apple", "monkey", "plea"}   
        str = "abpcplea"  
Output : apple

Input  : dict = {"pintu", "geeksfor", "geeksgeeks", 
                                        " forgeek"} 
         str = "geeksforgeeks"
Output : geeksgeeks


Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer x denoting the no of words in the dictionary. Then in the next line are x space separated strings denoting the contents of the dictionary.  Then in the next line is a string 'str'.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required output.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=x, length of str<=1000

Example:
Input:
2
4
ale apple monkey plea
abpcplea
4
pintu geeksfor geeksgeeks forgeek
geeksforgeeks
