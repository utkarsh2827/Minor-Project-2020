Given a N X N matrix (M) filled with 1, 0, 2, 3. The task is to find whether there is a path possible from source to destination, while traversing through blank cells only. You can traverse up, down, right and left.
A value of cell 1 means Source.
A value of cell 2 means Destination.
A value of cell 3 means Blank cell.
A value of cell 0 means Blank Wall.
Note: there is only single source and single destination.
Input:
The first line of input is an integer T denoting the no of testcases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the square matrix. Then in the next line are N*N space separated values of the matrix (M).
Output:
For each test case in a new line print 1 if the path exist from source to destination else print 0.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 20
1 <= N <= 20
Example:
Input:
2
4
3 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 3 0 2 3 3 
3
0 3 2 3 0 0 1 0 0
Output:
1
0
Explanation:
Testcase 1: The matrix for the above given input is:
3 0 0 0
0 3 3 0
0 1 0 3
0 2 3 3
From the matrix we can see that there exists a path from to reach destination 2 from source 1.
Testcase 2: The matrix for the above given input is:
0 3 2
3 0 0
1 0 0
From the matrix we can see that there does not exists any path to reach destination 2 from source 1.
