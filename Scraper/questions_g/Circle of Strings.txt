Given an array of strings A[], determine if the strings can be chained together to form a circle. A
string X can be chained together with another string Y if the last character of X is same as first
character of Y. If every string of the array can be chained, it will form a circle.
For eg for the array arr[] = {"for", "geek", "rig", "kaf"} the answer will be Yes as the given strings can be chained as "for", "rig", "geek" and "kaf"
Input
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases
follow. 
The first line of each test case contains a positive integer N, denoting the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains a N space seprated strings, denoting the elements of the
array A[].
Output
If chain can be formed, then print 1, else print 0.
Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
0 <= N <= 30
0 <= A[i] <= 10
Examples
Input
2
3
abc bcd cdf
4
ab bc cd da
Output
0
1
Explanation:
Testcase 1: Only strings "abc" and "cdf" follows the pattern chaining strings together but not "bcd" as none of other two strings begin with the character 'd'. Thus formation of circle of strings fails.
Testcase 2: Every string is given such that, first and last character follows chaining pattern to form circle of strings.
