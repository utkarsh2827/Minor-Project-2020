Given a value n, find out the largest palindrome number which is product of two n digit numbers.
Examples:
Input  : n = 2
Output : 9009 
9009 is the largest number which is product of two 
2-digit numbers. 9009 = 91*99.

Input : n = 1
Output : 9


Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer n.
Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required output.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 6
1 <= n <= 6
Example:
Input:
2
