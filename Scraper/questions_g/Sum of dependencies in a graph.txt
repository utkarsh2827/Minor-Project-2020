Given a directed graph with n nodes. If there is an edge from u to v then u depends on v. Our task is to find out the sum of dependencies for every node.
Example:
For the graph in diagram, A depends on C and D i.e. 2, B depends on D i.e. 1, C depends on D i.e. 1
and D depends on none.
Hence answer -> 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two integers N and E denoting the no of vertices and edges of the graph. Then in the next line are E pairs u and v denoting an edge from u to v.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print the required output.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
2<=N<=150
1<=E<=150
