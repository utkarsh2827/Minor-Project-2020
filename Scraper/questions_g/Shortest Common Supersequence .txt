Given two strings str1 and str2, find the length of the smallest string which has both, str1 and str2 as its sub-sequences.
Note: str1 and str2 can have both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated strings.
Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, output the length of the required string.
Expected Time Complexity: O(Length(str1) * Length(str2)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Length(str1) * Length(str2)).
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1<= |str1|, |str2| <= 100
Example:
Input:
2
abcd xycd
efgh jghi
Output:
6
6
Explanation:
Test Case 1: One of the shortest answer can be abxycd, which is of length 6.
