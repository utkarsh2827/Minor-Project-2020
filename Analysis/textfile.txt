Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. 
The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger 
and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
The main story arc concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends 
to become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and 
subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).

Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, 
the books have found immense popularity, positive reviews and commercial success worldwide. 
They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered 
cornerstones of modern young adult literature.[2] As of February 2018, the books have sold more 
than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have 
been translated into eighty languages.[3] The last four books consecutively set records as the 
fastest-selling books in history, with the final installment selling roughly eleven million copies 
in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.
