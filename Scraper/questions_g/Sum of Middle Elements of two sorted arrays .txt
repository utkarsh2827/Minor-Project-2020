Given 2 sorted arrays A and B of size N each. Print sum of middle elements of the array obtained after merging the given arrays.
Input:
The first line contains T denoting the number of testcases. Then follows description of testcases.
Each case begins with a single positive integer N denoting the size of array. The second line contains the N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array A. The third line contains N space separated positive integers denoting the elements of array B.
Output:
For each testcase, print the sum of middle elements of two sorted arrays. The number of the elements in the merged array are even so there will be 2 numbers in the center n/2 and n/2 +1. You have to print their sum. 
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= A[i] <= 106
1 <= B[i] <= 106
Example:
Input :
1
5
1 2 4 6 10
4 5 6 9 12
Output : 
11
Explanation:
Testcase 1: After merging two arrays, sum of middle elements is 11 (5 + 6).
