For given string ‘str’ of digits, find length of the longest substring of ‘str’, such that the length of the substring is 2k digits and sum of left k digits is equal to the sum of right k digits.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case contains a string string of length N.

Output:
Print length of the longest substring of length 2k such that sum of left k elements is equal to right k elements and if there is no such substring print 0.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
