Given a Binary Tree, you need to find the maximum value which you can get by subtracting the value of node B from the value of node A, where A and B are two nodes of the binary tree and A is an ancestor of B. 
Example 1:
Input:
    5
 /    \
2      1
Output: 4
Explanation:The maximum difference we can
get is 4, which is bewteen 5 and 1.
Example 2:
Input:
      1
    /    \
   2      3
           \
            7
Output: -1
Explanation:The maximum difference we can
get is -1, which is between 1 and 2.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function maxDiff() which finds the maximum difference between the node and its ancestor.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(H).
Note: H is the height of the tree.
Constraints:
1 <= Number of edges <= 104
0 <= Data of a node <= 105
