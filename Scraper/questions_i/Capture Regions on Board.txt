Problem DescriptionGiven a 2D character matrix A of size N x M, containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Problem Constraints1 <= N, M <= 103Input FormatFirst and only argument 2D character matrix A of size N X M.Output FormatMake changes to the the input only as matrix is passed by reference.Example InputInput 1:
 A = [  [X, X, X, X],
        [X, O, O, X],
        [X, X, O, X],
        [X, O, X, X]
     ]


Example OutputOutput 1:
 A = [  [X, X, X, X],
        [X, X, X, X],
        [X, X, X, X],
        [X, O, X, X]
     ]


Example ExplanationExplanation 1:
 'O' in (4,2) is not surrounded by X from below.
