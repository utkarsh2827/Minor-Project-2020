Problem DescriptionGiven an array of integers A and multiple values in B which represents the indices of the array A around which left rotation of the array A needs to be performed.
Find the rotated array for each value and return the result in the from of a matrix where i'th row represents the rotated array for the i'th value in B.
Problem Constraints1 <= length of both arrays <= 2000
-109 <= A[i] <= 109 
0 <= B[i] <= 2000Input FormatThe first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer array B.Output FormatReturn the resultant matrix.Example InputInput 1:
 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 B = [2, 3]
Input 2:
 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
 B = [1]
Example OutputOutput 1:
 [ [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
 [4, 5, 1, 2, 3] ]

Output 2:
 [ [17, 100, 11, 5] ]
