Given two strings a and b. The task is to find if a string 'a' can be obtained by rotating another string 'b' by 2 places.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. In the next two line are two string a and b.
Output:
For each test case in a new line print 1 if the string 'a' can be obtained by rotating string 'b' by two places else print 0.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= length of a, b < 100
Example:
Input:
2
amazon
azonam
geeksforgeeks
geeksgeeksfor
Output:
1
0
Explanation:
Testcase 1: amazon can be rotated anti-clockwise by two places, which will make it as azonam.
Testcase 2: geeksgeeksfor can't be formed by any rotation from the given word geeksforgeeks.
