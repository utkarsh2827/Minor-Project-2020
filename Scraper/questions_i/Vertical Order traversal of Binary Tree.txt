Problem DescriptionGiven a binary tree A consisting of N nodes, return a 2-D array denoting the vertical order traversal of A.
Go through the example and image for more details.
NOTE:

If 2 or more Tree Nodes shares the same vertical level then the one with earlier occurence in the pre-order traversal of tree comes first in the output.
Row 1 of the output array will be the nodes on leftmost vertical line similarly last row of the output array will be the nodes on the rightmost vertical line.


Problem Constraints0 <= N <= 104Input FormatFirst and only argument is an pointer to root of the binary tree A.Output FormatReturn a 2D array denoting the vertical order traversal of A.Example InputInput 1:
      6
    /   \
   3     7
  / \     \
 2   5     9

Input 2:
 1
         /   \
        2     3
       / \
      4   5


Example OutputOutput 1:
 [
    [2],
    [3],
    [6, 5],
    [7],
    [9]
 ]

Output 2:
 [
    [4],
    [2],
    [1, 5],
    [3]
 ]


Example ExplanationExplanation 1:
 
 Nodes on Vertical Line 1: 2
 Nodes on Vertical Line 2: 3
 Nodes on Vertical Line 3: 6, 5
    As 6 and 5 are on the same vertical level but as 6 comes first in the pre-order traversal of the tree so we will output 6 before 5.
 Nodes on Vertical Line 4: 7
 Nodes on Vertical Line 5: 9

Explanation 2:
 Nodes on Vertical Line 1: 4
 Nodes on Vertical Line 2: 2
 Nodes on Vertical Line 3: 1, 5
 Nodes on Vertical Line 4: 3
