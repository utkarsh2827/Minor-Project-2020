Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
Example 1:
Input:
            1
          /   \
         3     2
        /
       4           
Output: 2
Explanation:
Minimum depth is between nodes 1 and 3.
Example 2:
Input:
             10
          /     \
        20       30
          \        \   
          40        60 
                   /
                  2 
Output: 3
Explanation:
Minimum depth is between nodes 10,20 and 40.
Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function minDepth() which takes root node as input parameter and returns the minimum depth.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(height of tree)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
