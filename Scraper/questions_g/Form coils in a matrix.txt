Given a positive integer n that represents dimensions of a 4n x 4n matrix with values from 1 to 4*n*4n filled from left to right and top to bottom. Your task is to form two coils from matrix and print the coils.
Examples:
Input  : n = 1;
Output : Coil 1 : 10 6 2 3 4 8 12 16 
         Coil 2 : 7 11 15 14 13 9 5 1
Explanation : Matrix is 
1  2  3  4 
5  6  7  8 
9  10 11 12 
13 14 15 16

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer n.

Output:
For each test case output two lines where line 1 contains the space separated values of the coil1 and line 2 contains space separated values of the coil2. The coil 1 is the coil whose starting element is the greatest.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=n<=20

Example:
Input:
1
1
Output:
10 6 2 3 4 8 12 16
7 11 15 14 13 9 5 1
