Given a number N. The task is to find the length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N.
Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print the length of the longest consecutive 1's in N's binary representation.
Constraints:
1 <= T < 100
1 <= N <= 103
Example:
Input:
2
14
222
Output:
3 
4
Explanation:
Testcase 1: Binary representation of 14 is 1110, in which 111 is the longest consecutive set bits and length is 3.
