Problem DescriptionGiven two strings A and B. Find the longest common sequence ( A sequence which does not need to be contiguous), which is common in both the strings.
You need to return the length of such longest common subsequence.
Problem Constraints1 <= |A|, |B| <= 1005Input FormatFirst argument is an string A.
Second argument is an string B.
Output FormatReturn the length of such longest common subsequence between string A and string B.Example InputInput 1:
 A = "abbcdgf"
 B = "bbadcgf"

Example OutputOutput 1:
 5

Example ExplanationExplanation 1:
 The longest common subsequence is "bbcgf", which has a length of 5
