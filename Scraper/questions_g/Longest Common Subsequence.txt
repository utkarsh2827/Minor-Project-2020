Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. Both the strings are of uppercase.
Input:
First line of the input contains no of test cases  T,the T test cases follow.
Each test case consist of 2 space separated integers A and B denoting the size of string str1 and str2 respectively
The next two lines contains the 2 string str1 and str2 .
Output:
For each test case print the length of longest  common subsequence of the two strings .
Constraints:
1<=T<=200
1<=size(str1),size(str2)<=100
Example:
Input:
2
6 6
ABCDGH
AEDFHR
3 2
ABC
AC
Output:
3
2
Explanation
LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
LCS of "ABC" and "AC" is "AC" of length 2
