Given a sorted and rotated array A of N distinct elements which is rotated at some point, and given an element K. The task is to find the index of the given element K in the array A.
Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the total number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the given array. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array A. Third line of each test case contains an integer K denoting the element to be searched in the array.
Output:
Corresponding to each test case, output the index of the element found in the array.  If element is not present, then output -1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 107
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 108
1 ≤ K ≤ 108
