Problem DescriptionGiven a binary tree A of integers. Return an array of integers representing the right view of the Binary tree.
Right view of a Binary Tree: is a set of nodes visible when the tree is visited from Right side.Problem Constraints1 <= Number of nodes in binary tree <= 105
0 <= node values <= 109 Input FormatFirst and only argument is an pointer to the root of binary tree A.Output FormatReturn an integer array denoting the right view of the binary tree A.Example InputInput 1:

        1
      /   \
     2    3
    / \  / \
