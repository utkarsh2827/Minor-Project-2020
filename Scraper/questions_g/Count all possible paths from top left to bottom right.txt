The task is to count all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either move only to right or down.
Input: 
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of N and M, denoting the number of rows and number of column respectively.
Output: 
Single line output i.e count of all the possible paths from top left to bottom right of a mXn matrix. Since output can be very large number use %10^9+7.
Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100
1<=M<=100
Example:
Input:
1
3 3
Output:
6
