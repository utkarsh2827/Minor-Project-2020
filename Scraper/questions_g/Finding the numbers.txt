Given an array A containing 2*N+2 positive numbers, out of which 2*N numbers exist in pairs whereas the other two number occur exactly once and are distinct. Find the other two numbers  (in ascending order).
Example 1:
Input: 
2
1 2 3 2 1 4
Output:
3 4 
Explanation: 3 and 4 occur exactly once.
Example 2:
Input:
1
2 1 3 2
Output:
1 3
Explanation: 1 3 occur exactly once.
Your Task:
You do not need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function singleNumber() which takes the array as input parameter and returns a list of two numbers which occur exactly once in the array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= length of array <= 106 
1 <= Elements in array <= 5 * 106
