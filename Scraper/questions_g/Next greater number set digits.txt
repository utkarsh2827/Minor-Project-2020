Given a number n, find the smallest number that has same set of digits as n and is greater than n. If x is the greatest possible number with its set of digits, then print “not possible”.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is n,n is the number.

Output:
Print the greater number than n with same set of digits and if not possible then print "not possible" without double quote.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 100000

Example:
