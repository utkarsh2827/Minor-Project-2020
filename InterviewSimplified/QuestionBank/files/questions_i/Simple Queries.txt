Problem DescriptionYou are given an array A having N integers.
You have to perform the following steps in a given order.
1) generate all subarrays of A.
2) take the maximum element from each subarray of A and insert it into a new array G.
3) replace every element of G with the product of their divisors mod 1e9 + 7.
4) sort G in descending order
You now need to perform Q queries
In each query, you are given an integer K, where you have to find the Kth element in G.
NOTE : Your solution will run on multiple test cases so do clear global variables after using them.
Problem Constraints1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= A[i] <= 1e5
1 <= Q <= 1e5
1 <= k <= (N * (N + 1))/2 
Input FormatThe first argument given is an Array A, having N integers.
The second argument given is an Array B, where B[i] is the ith query.
Output FormatReturn an Array X, where X[i] will have the answer for the ith query.Example InputInput 1:
 A = [1, 2, 4]
B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



Input 2:








 A = [1, 3]
B = [1]






Example OutputOutput 1:
 [8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 1]



Output 2:








 [3]






Example ExplanationExplanation 1:
 subarrays of A    maximum element

[1]      1
[1, 2]   2
[1, 2, 4]4
[2]      2
[2, 4]   4
[4]      4

original
G = [1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4]
after changing every element of G with product of their divisors
G = [1, 2, 8, 2, 8, 8]
after sorting G in descending order
G = [8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 1]



Explanation 2:








 Just perform given query.
