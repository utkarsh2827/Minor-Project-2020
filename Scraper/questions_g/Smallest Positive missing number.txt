You are given an array arr[] of N integers including 0. The task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.
Note: Expected solution in O(n) time using constant extra space.
Input:
First line consists of T test cases. First line of every test case consists of N, denoting the number of elements in array. Second line of every test case consists of elements in array.
Output:
Single line output, print the smallest positive number missing.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 106
-106 <= arr[i] <= 106
Example:
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
0 -10 1 3 -20
Output:
6
2
Explanation:
Testcase 1: Smallest positive missing number is 6.
Testcase 2: Smallest positive missing number is 2.
