A top secret message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26

You are an FBI agent. You have to determine the total number of ways that message can be decoded.
Note: An empty digit sequence is considered to have one decoding. It may be assumed that the input contains valid digits from 0 to 9 and If there are leading 0’s, extra trailing 0’s and two or more consecutive 0’s then it is an invalid string.
Example :
Given encoded message "123",  it could be decoded as "ABC" (1 2 3) or "LC" (12 3) or "AW"(1 23).
So total ways are 3.
Input:
First line contains the test cases T.  1<=T<=1000
Each test case have two lines
First is length of string N.  1<=N<=40
Second line is string S of digits from '0' to '9' of N length.
Example:
Input:
2
3
123
4
2563
Output:
3
2
