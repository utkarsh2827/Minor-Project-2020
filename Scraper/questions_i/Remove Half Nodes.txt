Problem DescriptionGiven a binary tree A with N nodes.
You have to remove all the half nodes and return the final binary tree.
NOTE:
Half nodes are nodes which have only one child.
Leaves should not be touched as they have both children as NULL.

Problem Constraints 1 <= N <= 105Input FormatFirst and only argument is an pointer to the root of binary tree A.Output FormatReturn a pointer to the root of the new binary tree.Example InputInput 1:
 1
         /   \
        2     3
       / 
      4

Input 2:
  1
/   \
         2     3
        / \     \
       4   5     6

Example OutputOutput 1:
 1
         /    \
        4      3

Output 2:
  1
/   \
         2     6
        / \
       4   5






Example ExplanationExplanation 1:
 The only half node present in the tree is 2 so we will remove this node.

Explanation 2:
 The only half node present in the tree is 3 so we will remove this node.
