Given two numbers as stings s1 and s2 your task is to multiply them.
Example 1:
Input:

s1 = 33
s2 = 2
Output: 66
Example 2:
Input:

s1 = 11
s2 = 23
Output: 253
Your Task:
You are required to complete the function multiplyStrings() which takes two strings s1 and s2 as its only argument and returns their product as strings.
Constraints:
1 <= length of s1 and s2 <= 103
Expected time complexity: O( n1 * n2 )
Expected auxiliary space: O( n1 + n2 ) ; where n1 and n2 are sizes of strings s1 and s2 respectively.
