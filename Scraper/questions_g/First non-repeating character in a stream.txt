Given an input stream of N characters consisting only of lower case alphabets. The task is to find the first non repeating character, each time a character is inserted to the stream. If no non repeating element is found print -1.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the stream. Then in the next line are x characters which are inserted to the stream.
Output:
For each test case in a new line print the first non repeating elements separated by spaces present in the stream at every instinct when a character is added to the stream, if no such element is present print -1.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 200
1 <= N <= 500
Example:
Input:
2
4
a a b c
3
a a c 
Output:
a -1 b b
a -1 c
Explanation:
Test Case 1: a a b c
The step wise first non-repeating elements are made bold:
a (print a)
a a (no non-repeating element, print -1)
a a b (print b)
a a b c (print b)
Result: a -1 b b
Test Case 2: a a c
a (print a)
a a (no non-repeating element, print -1)
a a c (print c)
Result: a -1 c
