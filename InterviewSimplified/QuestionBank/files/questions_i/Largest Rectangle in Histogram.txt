Given an array of integers A of size N. A represents a histogram i.e A[i] denotes height of 
the ith histogramâ€™s bar. Width of each bar is 1.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
Find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Input Format
The only argument given is the integer array A.


Output Format
Return the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.


For Example
Input 1:
    A = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
Output 1:
    10
    Explanation 1:
