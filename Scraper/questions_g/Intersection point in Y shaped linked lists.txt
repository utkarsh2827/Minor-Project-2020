Given two singly linked lists of size N and M, write a program to get the point where two linked lists intersect each other.

Above diagram shows an example with two linked list having 15 as intersection point.
Example 1:
Input:
LinkList1 = {10,20,5,10}
LinkList2 = {30,40,50,5,10}
Output: 5
Explanation:The point of intersection of
two linked list is 5, means both of them
get linked (intersects) with each other
at node whose value is 5.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function intersetPoint() which finds the point of intersection of two linked list. The function should return data value of a node where two linked lists merge. If linked list do not merge at any point, then it should return -1.
Challenge : Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N+M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= value <= 1000
