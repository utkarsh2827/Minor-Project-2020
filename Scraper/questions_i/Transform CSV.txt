Write a bash script to combine both CountryCode and PhoneNumber with a - and add a + before country code and remove country codes from the csv file
Example:
Assume that input has the following content:

Benoite,Ducket,9 Harper Alley,Tenenkou,22,bducket1@friendfeed.com,724-995-7769


Your script should output the following:
Lotty,Kilner,08 Boyd Place,Jiangqiao,lkilner0@epa.gov,+04-433-447-7966
Benoite,Ducket,9 Harper Alley,Tenenkou,bducket1@friendfeed.com,+22-724-995-7769
