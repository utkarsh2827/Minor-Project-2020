Given an array arr of length N consisting cost of toys. Given an integer K depicting the amount with you. The task is to Maximise the number of different toys you can have with K amount. 
Example 1:
Input: N = 7, K = 50
arr = {1, 12, 5, 111, 200, 1000, 10}
Output: 4
Explaination: The costs of the toys are 
1, 12, 5, 10.
Example 2:
Input: N = 3, K = 100
arr = {20, 30, 50}
Output: 3
Explaination: We can buy all types of 
toys.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function toyCount() which takes the value N, K and the array arr and returns the maximum count of toys.
Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ K, arr[i] ≤ 10000
