Given an array with positive number the task to find the largest subsequence from array that contain elements which are Fibonacci numbers.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array.
Output:
For each test case in a new line print the space separated elements of the  longest fibonacci subsequence.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=100
1<=A[]<=1000

Example:
Input:
2
7
1 4 3 9 10 13 7
9
0 2 8 5 2 1 4 13 23
Output:
1 3 13
0 2 8 5 2 1 13
