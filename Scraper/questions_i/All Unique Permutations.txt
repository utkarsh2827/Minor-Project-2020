Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.
Example :
[1,1,2] have the following unique permutations:
[1,1,2]
[1,2,1]
[2,1,1]



NOTE : No 2 entries in the permutation sequence should be the same.


Warning : DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR GENERATING PERMUTATIONS.
Example : next_permutations in C++ / itertools.permutations in python.
If you do, we will disqualify your submission retroactively and give you penalty points.
