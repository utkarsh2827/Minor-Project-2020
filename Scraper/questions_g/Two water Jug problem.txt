You are at the side of a river. You are given a m litre jug and a n litre jug where 0 < m < n. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs don’t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d litres of water where d < n. Determine the minimum no of operations to be performed to obtain d litres of water in one of jug.
The operations you can perform are:
Empty a Jug
Fill a Jug
Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full.
Input:
First line consists of T test cases. Only line of every test case consists of 3 spaced integers denoting m , n, and d respectively. 
Output:
Single line output, print the minimum number of operations.
Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N,D<=100
1<=M<=N
Example:
Input:
