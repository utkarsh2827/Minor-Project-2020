Given an array where each element is the money a person have and there is only Rs. 3 note. We need to check whether it is possible to divide the money equally among all the persons or not. If it is possible then find Minimum number of transactions needed.
Input:
The first line of input consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases Each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. Then in the next line are N space separated elements of the array.
Output: 
For each case in a new line print the minimum number of transactions if it is possible to divide the money else print "-1" without quotes.
Constraints:
1<=T<=500
1<=N<=1000
1<=elements of array <=10^6
Example:
Input:
2
