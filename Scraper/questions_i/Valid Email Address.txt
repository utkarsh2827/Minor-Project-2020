Write a bash script that finds all the invalid email addresses.
For simplicity, assume that a vaild email addresses has the following rules-

Email should be of the form local@domain.com
There can only be alphanumberic characters in the local part email address.

The following characters are valid in the local part of the email as long as they are not the first character.
-, _, +, .

Email address can not start with a number.
Domain name can only contain alphanumeric characters and -.
com part can have atmost one ., for e.g. co.uk or co.in is valid but as.df.gh is invalid

Example:
Assume that input has the following content:
abc@example.co.uk
abc@example.com
abc<>@example.com
abc@example@gmail.com


Your script should output the following:
abc<>@example.com
abc@example@gmail.com
