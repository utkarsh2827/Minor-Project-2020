Given a boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 (or true) then make all the cells of ith row and jth column as 1.
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case is r and c, r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns.
The second line of each test case contains all the elements of the matrix in a single line separated by a single space.
Output:
Print the modified array.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ r, c ≤ 1000
0 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 1
Example:
Input:
3
2 2
1 0 
0 0
2 3
0 0 0 
0 0 1
4 3
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
0 0 0
Output:
1 1
1 0
0 0 1 
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 0 0
Explanation:
Testcase1: Since only first element of matrix has 1 (at index 1,1) as value, so first row and first column are modified to 1.
