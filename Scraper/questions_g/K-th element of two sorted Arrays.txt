Given two sorted arrays A and B of size M and N respectively and an element k. The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.
Input:
First line consists of test cases T. First line of every test case consists of 3 integers N, M and K, denoting M number of elements in A, N number of elements in B and kth position element. Second and Third line of every test case consists of elements of A and B respectively.
Output:
Print the element at the Kth position.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 200
1 <= N, M <= 106
1 <= Ai, Bi <= 106
1 <= K <= N+M
Example:
Input:
1
5 4 5
2 3 6 7 9
1 4 8 10
Output:
6
Explanation:
Testcase 1: Element at 5th position after merging both arrays will be 6.
